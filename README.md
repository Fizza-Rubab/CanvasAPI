# CanvasAPI
Explore and utilize Canvas APIs

## Course
A course Canvas API 101(Id: 1923) has been created to experiment with the API. The course content has been imported from one of the past courses that I TAed, CS113.

## Folders and Scripts
There are three folders in the repo

- *myapi* folder contains scripts written by me using the python requests module by making use of the official canvas api [documentation](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/)
- *api* folder consists of scripts written by using a python package for canvas ([canvas-lms-api 0.4.1](https://pypi.org/project/canvas-lms-api/))
- *canvasapi* folder, the most heavily populated one contains scripts written by reading and understanding the [canvasapi python package](https://readthedocs.org/projects/canvasapi-test/downloads/pdf/stable/).

The most relevant is the **canvasapi** and myapi folder. You may find alot of things repetitive but that is just me exploring options and experimenting on stuff.


## Installation and Requirements
Prior to running the scripts, you need to execute the following commands
- `pip install canvasapi`
- `pip install canvas-lms-api`


## Ending Note and a few suggestions
- This was fun, thank you! 
- Don't delete my course. You won't be able to run the rest of the scripts(saying from past experiences)
- Please Don't use my authorization token.
